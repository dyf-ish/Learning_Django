This is a record of my progress in learning Django. It includes knowledge of front-end, back-end, MySQL, and Python. It may also be useful for those who want to learn Django. My entire learning progress primarily relies on the video lectures from [最新Python的web开发全家桶（django+前端+数据库）](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT4y1v7uQ/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=916a29382deff2a70494e371bf417134). I have also included the source code of my practice project in the directory `testProject1`. It may contain my personal API key for NewsAPI, so I kindly ask that anyone using my source code use their own API key. You can register for a non-commercial API key for free on its [official website]([News API – Search News and Blog Articles on the Web](https://newsapi.org/)).
